vscode uses emmet to give basic starter code
emmet abbreviations

inject react from cdn using two scripts
react.development.js - core react framework
react-dom.development.js - framework required to modify the dom object

React API from react.development
react - helps to create core components or elements in html like headers, divs etc
React.createElement(
1st argument - type of element - h1/div/etc
2nd argument - an object, a dictionary of attributes to be passed to the element like id, styles, etc
3rd argument - content to be added inside the new element/ the children of the element
)

the children of an element can be a whole new element. this idea can be leveraged to create nested components of html.

if we try to print this react element, it's not a simple html code, it's a react/javascript object with multiple attributes

one of them is props, which contains the attributes and children of the element that we create

ReactDOM API from react-dom.development
ReactDOM helps with manipulating DOM and it's internal tree structure
ReactDOM needs to know the position of the root of the HTML document in order to manipulate the content

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementbyID("root"));
root.render(element to be rendered);

root.render replaces the existing content with the new elements
